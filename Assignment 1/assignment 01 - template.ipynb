    "Based on these results, it can be suggested that both Biden and Trump tend to tweet more negavtive words than positive words as given by the larger negativity ratios as well as the less than 1 positive to negative ratio. However, it can be seen from these results that although both Biden and Trump tweet more negative words than positive words, Biden has a significantlly higher positive to negative ratio. This would imply that while Biden still tweets more negative words than positive words, he tweets more positive words than Trump proportionally."
